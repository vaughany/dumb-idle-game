# Dumb Idle Game

A small project to learn a little JavaScript and make a dumb idle-clicker style game.


## How to use

Load the `game.html` file into your browser. Experience the awesomeness. 


## Files

* `game.html`: bare minimum HTML required to use Bootstrap 5.2 and load the `game.js` file.
* `game.js`: where all the JS will go. 


## History

* **v0.0.0**: The absolute bare minimum HTML and JavaScript required to 1. [use Bootstrap 5.2](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/), and 2. ensure console.log() works.
* **v0.0.1**: Got a button, and clicking it increments a variable which then updates on-screen. Some small quality-of-life improvements, such as app version in the page title, better layout, etc. Does not survive page reloads.
* **v0.0.2**: It saves the number of clicks to local storage on a timer (30s by default) and manually; it loads the number of clicks at startup (with sanity-checking); it has a reset button with a confirmation box.
